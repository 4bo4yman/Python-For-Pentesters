<h1>$${\color{red}SSH} \space {\color{green}Brute}\space {\color{blue}Forcing}$$</h1>

##### The powerful Python language is supported by a number of modules that easily extend its capabilities. Paramiko is an SSHv2 implementation that will be useful in building SSH clientsand servers. 
> The example below shows one way to build an SSH password brute force attack script. As is often the case in programming, there rarely is a single correct answer for these kinds of applications. 
> As a penetration tester, your usage of programming languages will be different for developers. 
> While they may care about best practices and code hygiene, your goal will more often be to end with a code that works as you want it to.
> By now, you should be familiar with the "try" and "except" syntax. 
> This script has one new feature, "def". "Def" allows us to create custom functions, as seen below. 
> The "ssh_connect" function is not native to Python but built using Paramiko and the "paramiko.SSHClient()" function.
