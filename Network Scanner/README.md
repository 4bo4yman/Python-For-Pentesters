<h1>$${\color{red}Network} \space {\color{green}Scanner}$$</h1>

#### Python can be used to build a simple ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanner to identify potential targets on the network.

> However, ICMP packets can be monitored or blocked as the target organization would not expect a regular user to “ping a server”. On
the other hand, systems can be configured to not respond to ICMP requests. These are the main reasons why using the ARP (Address
Resolution Protocol) to identify targets on the local network is more effective.
